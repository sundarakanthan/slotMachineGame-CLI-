<h1>slotMachineGame (CLI)</h1>
<h4>(Disclaimer:- This project was built only for learning purpose. I don't support or promote gambling.)</h4>

This is a simple command line based slot machine game built using pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS). <br>
Built this to implement all the basic javascript concepts in one project. <br>

<h4>Concept: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>User has to deposit an amount.</li>
  <li>Then they have to specify how many lines they are going to bet on.</li>
  <li>After placing the slot machine is spinned and we will get random symbols.</li>
  <li>If same symbols appear on a same row depending upon the number of lines they bet they will get the winning amount multiplied by the number of lines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Working:</h4>
I have used Javascript objects to store the symbols and then another object to store the symbol values.<br>
Used enhanced for loops , for each loops to iterate over the objects and generate random symbols.
